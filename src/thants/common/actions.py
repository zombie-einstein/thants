    Derive environment updates from integer action choices

    Maps integer to discrete actions as follows:

    - 0: Take no action
    - 1-4 Move in one of the cardinal directions
    - 5: Take a fixed amount of food
    - 6: Deposit a fixed amount of food
    - 7+: Deposit a fixed amount of sigal of type `i - 7`

    Parameters
    ----------
    actions
        Array of integer action choices
    take_food_amount
        Amount of food picked up by a take_food actions
    deposit_food_amount
        Amount of food dropped up by a take_food actions
    signal_deposit_amount
        Amount of signal deposited by the signal deposit action
